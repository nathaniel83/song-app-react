There's a knock at the door that I adore
There's a face at the window, a smiling yellow face
There's a knock at the door
And if I were at home, they'd find me there 
There's a note on the door that I would see 
And the furniture's barely been moved from where it was 
There's a note on the door 
And the note would say when it rains, it snows 

When it rains, it snows I wonder why 
And now I know 
That when it rains, it snows 

There's a nut with a shotgun -- bang bang bang 
There's a doctor, a waitress, a fireman with a hat 
There's a nut with a gun 
There's enough so they'll never know which one 

When it rains, it snows 
I wonder why 
And now I know 
That when it rains, it snows
