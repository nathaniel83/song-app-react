I wait underneath the covers
All night beside you
And who could ever question any crying I do

My heavy heart is beating out a rhythm
All night inside me
And I fall a little harder every time that I do

Watch me living it up, you totally
Got me stuck in a rut, you're made for me
How am I gonna step up and say to you
I get the feeling boy, I want you, want you

Conversation is tough because you're totally
Walking around all the stuff you wanna say to me
Words are never enough
Oh, baby, baby, you turn my dust to gold

I can't speak French
So I'll let the funky music do the talking talking
Now oh
I can't speak French
So I'll let the funky music do the talking

Oh, oh, oh
I can't speak French
So I'll let the funky music do the talking talking
Now oh
I can't speak French
So I'll let the funky music do the talking

I gotta let you know
I wanna give in to my temptation
And let my feelings show
I gotta let you know oh, oh, oh

I gotta let you know
I wanna give in to my temptation
And let my feelings show
I gotta let you know oh, oh, oh

I can't speak French
So I'll let the funky music do the talking talking
Now oh
I can't speak French so I'll let the funky
Music do the talking

Oh, oh, oh
I can't speak French
So I'll let the funky music do the talking talking
Now oh
I can't speak French
So I'll let the funky music do the talking
