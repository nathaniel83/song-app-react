As loud as hell 
A ringing bell
Behind my smile 
It shakes my teeth
And all the while
As vampires feed
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed

Prithee, my dear
Why are we here?
Nobody knows
We go to sleep
As breathing flows
My mind secedes
I bleed
I bleed 
I bleed 
I bleed 
I bleed 
I bleed

There's a place 
In the buried west 
In a cave
With a house in it 
In the clay
The holes of hands
You can place 
A hand in hand
I bleed 
I bleed 
I bleed
