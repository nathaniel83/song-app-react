I’m sick of being the bitch
That you think I am
Well, I never understood
Understood that man
Well, it’s funny how these kind of things
Happen to them
When you never even think they would happen again

I’m sick of being the bitch
That you think I am
Well, I never understood
Understood that man
Well, it’s funny how these kind of things
Happen to them
When you never even think they would happen again

I gave you everything
You did not let me in
My words caught in between
Knowing what was good for me

What’s the difference between
Living free and hurting me
This has been quite challenging
But now I’m thinking differently
Too proud to ask for help
That makes it difficult
Should I just follow suit? 
Try and figure out myself?
Or should I concentrate?
Concentrate on myself?
Or will that leave me here inside my low self-obsessed life?
Why is it like I’m changing (something) life
(Something) go get high
Well no, you like me
You kinda like me
(Something) a girl now do you love me?
Well I’m just a girl
And that’s good enough for me
Hey hey!

I’m sick of being the bitch
That you think I am
Well, I never understood
Understood that man
Well, it’s funny how these kind of things
Happen to them
When you never even think they would happen again

I’m sick of being the bitch
That you think I am
Well, I never understood
Understood that man
Well, it’s funny how these kind of things
Happen to them
When you never even think they would happen again

I’m sick of being the bitch
That you think I am
Well, I never understood
Understood that man
Well, it’s funny how these kind of things
Happen to them
When you never even think they would happen again

I’m sick of being the bitch
That you think I am
Well, I never understood
Understood that man
Well, it’s funny how these kind of things
Happen to them
When you never even think they would happen again
