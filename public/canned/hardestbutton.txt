We started living in an old house
My ma gave birth and we were checking it out
It was a baby boy, so we bought him a toy
It was a ray gun and it was 1981

We named him Baby, he had a toothache
He started crying, it sounded like an earthquake
It didn't last long because I stopped it
I grabbed a rag doll and stuck some little pins in it

Now were a family and were alright now
We got money and a little place to fight now
We don't know you and we don't owe you
But if you see us around I got something else to show you

Now, its easy when you don't know better
You think its sleazy? Then put it in a short letter
We keep warm but theres just something wrong
When you just feel that youre the hardest little button to button

I had opinions that didn't matter
I had a brain that felt like pancake batter
I got a backyard with nothing in it
Except a stick, a dog and a box with something in it

The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button, uh oh

The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button, uh oh
The hardest button to button

The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button
The hardest button to button, oh no
