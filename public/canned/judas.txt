Oh oh, oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas
Oh oh, oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas
Judas, Juda-a-a, Judas, Juda-a-a
Judas Juda-a-a, Judas, Gaga
Judas Juda-a-a, Judas, Juda-a-a
Judas, Juda-a-a, Judas, Gaga
When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times, he betrays me
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
A king with no crown, king with no crown
I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Oh oh, oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas
Oh oh, oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas
Judas, Juda-a-a, Judas, Juda-a-a
Judas, Juda-a-a, Judas, Gaga
I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his goofy way
I've learned love is like a brick you can
Build a house or sink a dead body
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
A king with no crown, king with no crown
I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Oh oh, oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas
Oh oh, oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas
In the most biblical sense, I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute wench, vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense I just speak in future tense
Judas kiss me if offense, don't wear ear condom next time
I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue
And Judas is the demon I cling to, I cling to
Just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a holy fool, oh baby it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Oh oh, oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas
Oh oh, oh oh
I'm in love with Judas, Judas
Judas, Juda-a-a, Judas, Juda-a-a
Judas, Juda-a-a, Judas, Gaga
