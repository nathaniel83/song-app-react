He wants to know
What it feels like to mess around, mess around
She wants to know
What it feels like to settle down, settle down
He's got the money but, oh it's not enough
He wants to pounce, he wants to pounce
Never knowing if he's given you up
Or if you're just not good enough
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

She wants to know why he's not home
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
He never answers the phone
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque

He wants to go
Where the red light shines so bright, shines so bright
He wants to know
Why he feels so cold inside, cold inside
He turns and looks around, he doesn't hear a sound
No ones around, no ones around
Never knowing if he's given you up
Or if you're just not good enough
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

She wants to know why he's not home
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
He never answers the phone
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque

She wants to know why he's not home
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
He never answers the phone
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque

She wants to know why he's not home
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
He never answers the phone
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque

He never answers the phone
Oh I bet money, money, money I bet
He's at the Sexotheque
(I bet oh I bet he's at the Sexotheque, he's at the Sexotheque)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

He's at the Sexotheque
