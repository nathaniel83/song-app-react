Something about the way you taste 
Makes me want to clear my throat 
There's a method to your movements 
That really gets my goat 
I looked for silver linings 
But you're rotten to the core 
I've had just about all I can take 
You know I can't take it no more 

I've got a gut feeling 
I've got a gut feeling 
I've got a gut feeling, feeling 

Centered 'round long time ago 
On your ability to torment 
Then you took your tongs of love 
And stripped away my garment 
I looked for silver linings 
But you're rotten to the core 
I've had just about all I can take 
You know I can't take it no more 

I've got a gut feeling 
I've got a gut feeling 
I've got a gut feeling, feeling 

I've got a gut feeling 
I've got a gut feeling, feeling 

I've got a gut feeling 
I've got a gut feeling, feeling 

I've got a gut feeling 
I've got a gut feeling, feeling 

I've got a gut feeling 
I've got a gut feeling, feeling 

I've got a gut feeling 
I've got a gut... woooo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo... OHHH

Slap your mammy down 
Slap your pappy down again 

Slap your mammy down 
Slap your pappy down again 

Slap your mammy down 
Slap your pappy down again 

Slap your mammy down 
Slap your pappy down again 

Slap your mammy down 
Slap your pappy down again, oh move it up and down now 

Slap your mammy down 
Slap your pappy down again, oh move it all around now 

Slap your mammy down 
Slap your pappy down again, oh move it up and down now 

Slap your mammy down 
Slap your pappy down again, oh move it all around now
