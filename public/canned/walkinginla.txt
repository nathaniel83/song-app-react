Look ahead as we pass, try and focus on it
I won't be fooled by a cheap cinematic trick
It must have been just a cardboard cut out of a man
Top forty, cast off from a record stand

Walkin' in LA
Walkin' in LA, nobody walks in LA
Walkin' in LA
Walkin' in LA, nobody walks in LA

I don't know could've been a lame jogger maybe
Or someone just about to do the freeway strangler baby
Shopping cart pusher or maybe someone groovy
One thing's for sure, he isn't starring in the movies
'Cause he's walkin' in LA
Walkin' in LA, nobody walks in LA
Walkin' in LA
Walkin' in LA, only a nobody walks in LA

Walkin', walkin', walkin'
Nobody's walkin', walkin', walkin'
Nobody's walkin', walkin', walkin'
Nobody's walkin', walkin', walkin'

You won't see a cop walkin' on the beat
Nobody's walkin', walkin', walkin'

You only see 'em drivin' cars out on the street
Nobody's walkin', walkin', walkin'

You won't see a kid walkin' home from school
Nobody's walkin', walkin', walkin'

Their mothers pick 'em up in a car pool
Nobody's walkin', walkin'

Walkin' in LA
Walkin' in LA, nobody walks in LA
Walkin' in LA
Walkin' in LA, nobody walks in LA

Could it be that the smog's playing tricks on my eyes
Or is a roller skater some kind of headphone disguise
Maybe somebody who just ran out of gas
Making his way back to the pumps the best way he can

Walkin' in LA
Walkin' in LA, nobody walks in LA
Walkin' in LA
Walkin' in LA, nobody walks in LA
Walkin' in LA
Walkin' in LA, nobody walks in LA
Walkin' in LA
Walkin' in LA, only a nobody walks in LA

Nobody's walkin' walkin' walkin' walkin' walkin'
Walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin'
Walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin'
Walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin'
Walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin'
Walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin'

Nobody walks in LA
