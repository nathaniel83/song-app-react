Lying awake for hours
Time stands still around me
Teardrops feel like showers
I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours
With just your broken flowers
Teardrops feel like showers
There's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours
Time stands still around me
Teardrops feel like showers
I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours
With just your broken flowers
Teardrops feel like showers
There's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours
Time stands still around me
Teardrops feel like showers
I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours
With just your broken flowers
Teardrops feel like showers
There's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours
Time stands still around me
Teardrops feel like showers
I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours
With just your broken flowers
Teardrops feel like showers
There's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours
Time stands still around me
Teardrops feel like showers
I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours
With just your broken flowers
Teardrops feel like showers
There's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours
Time stands still around me
Teardrops feel like showers
I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours
With just your broken flowers
Teardrops feel like showers
There's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours
Time stands still around me
Teardrops feel like showers
I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours
With just your broken flowers
Teardrops feel like showers
There's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours
Time stands still around me
Teardrops feel like showers
I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours
With just your broken flowers
Teardrops feel like showers
There's nothing I can see
Lying awake for hours
Time stands still around me
Teardrops feel like showers
I thought I was free
Lying awake for hours
With just your broken flowers
