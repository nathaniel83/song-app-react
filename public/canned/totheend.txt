Lying out in the dark
Thinking about everything
My heart can only give you a part
Of the love that you lost right at the start

Lying out in the dark
Thinking about everything
My heart can only give you a part
Of the love that you lost right at the start

I will only bring you happiness
Boy you’re always wanting more
But if only you’d let

Just a little bit of happiness
Into your eyes
Then we can compromise
Forgive and forget

I will only bring you happiness
Boy you’re always wanting more
But if only you’d let

Just a little bit of happiness
Into your eyes
Then we can compromise
Forgive and forget

Baby we will take this to the end
Baby we will take this to the end

Lying out in the dark
Thinking about everything
My heart Can only give you a part
Of the love that you lost right at the start

I will only bring you happiness
Buy your hours more and more
But if only you’d let

Just a little bit of happiness
Into your eyes
Then we can compromise
Forgive and forget

I will only bring you happiness
Buy your hours more and more
But if only you’d let

Just a little bit of happiness
Into your eyes
Then we can compromise
Forgive and forget
Baby we will take this to the end
Baby we will take this to the end
Baby we will take this to the end
Baby we will take this to the end

Let’s not get over excited,
You want it bad then fight it,
Who knows what the future holds,
Better do what you’re told,
Every little piece of me,
I’ll give to you for free,
Happiness don’t mean a thing,
Until you let it in.

(I’ll love)
