Free falling, free falling
It's like I'm free falling, it's a change of course

Here I am I sing the verse, sing the verse, sing the verse
Upside down and in reverse, in reverse, in reverse
Here I am I sing the verse, sing the verse, sing the verse
Upside down and in reverse, in reverse, in reverse

Free falling, free falling...
It's like I'm free falling it's a change of course

Feel the pressure in my head
Feel it happening again

Here I am I sing the verse, sing the verse, sing the verse
Upside down and in reverse, in reverse, in reverse
Here I am I sing the verse, sing the verse, sing the verse
Upside down and in reverse, in reverse, in reverse

Here I am I sing the verse, sing the verse, sing the verse
Upside down and in reverse, in reverse, in reverse
Here I am I sing the verse, sing the verse, sing the verse
Upside down and in reverse, in reverse, in reverse

Here I am I sing the verse, sing the verse, sing the verse,
Upside down and in reverse, in reverse, in reverse
Feel the pressure in my head
Feel it happening again
Feel the pressure in my head
Feel it happening again
Feel the pressure in my head...
