Victim of my own good intentions
I can't say no
My hands tied, I'm trying to stay afloat

I've been feeling like I'm out on the edge again
My breathing shallow, I can't pretend

Little white lies
We keep to ourselves
We'll never tell
Ain't hurting nobody
Little white lies
Nobody else needs to get hurt
Oh 'cause they'll never know
Little white lies
We keep to ourselves
We'll never tell
Ain't hurting nobody
Little white lies
Nobody else needs to get hurt
Oh 'cause they'll never know

Victim of my own good intentions
I can't say no
And all my thoughts can't shove when I'm alone
Victim of my own good intentions
I can't say no
My hands tied, I'm trying to stay afloat

I've been feeling like I'm out on the edge again
My breathing shallow, I can't pretend

Little white lies
We keep to ourselves
We'll never tell
Ain't hurting nobody
Little white lies
Nobody else needs to get hurt
Oh 'cause they'll never know
Little white lies
We keep to ourselves
We'll never tell
Ain't hurting nobody
Little white lies
Nobody else needs to get hurt
Oh 'cause they'll never know
