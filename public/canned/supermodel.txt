You better work
(Cover girl)
Work it, girl
(Give a twirl )
Do your thing on the runway
Work
(Supermodel)
You better work it, girl
(Of the world )
Wet your lips and make love to the camera
Work, turn to the left
Work, now turn to the right
Work, sashay, shante
Work, turn to the left
Work, now turn to the right
Work, sashay, shante
It don't matter what you wear
They're checking out your savoir-faire
And it don't matter what you do
Cause everything looks good on you

And when you walked into the room
You had everybody's eyes on you

Shantay, shantay, shantay
I have one thing to say, sashay, shante, shante, shante
Shante, shante, shante, whoa
