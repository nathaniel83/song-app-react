Why don't you fool me,
Feed me, say you need me
Without wicked games?
Come on and hold me,
Hug me, say you'll love me
And not my dirty brain.

Why don't you fool me,
Feed me, say you need me
Without wicked games?
Come on and hold me,
Hug me, say you'll love me
And not my dirty brain.

I got one Alabama return
That'll take me far away from you.
'cause when you take me in your arms
I turn to slave.
I can't be saved.

So I got my cappuccino to go
And I'm heading for the hills again.
'cause if we party anymore
We'll start a fire of pure desire.

Closer, your mind's firing blind
With your head in your face getting
Red in your heart beats closer
You fall on your knees and the
Geek at your feet says you're neat
And the beat gets closer.
You dive for the thrill at
The kill but your heart's had its fill
But it still creeps closer
You wanted to freeze but you're
Weak, in too deep,
And the beat
And the beat gets closer

Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer

We give it up
And then they take it away.
A girl's got to zip it up
And get her head in the shade.
Baby, if we give it up
It's just a matter of time
Before all the heavy stuff
Comes back to bite your behind.

You can't mistake my biology.

The way that we talk
The way that we walk
It's there in our thoughts

The magic number is in front of me

The way that we talk
The way that we walk
So easily caught

You can't mistake my biology

The way that we talk
The way that we walk
It's there in our thoughts

We're gonna cause a controversy

The way that we talk
The way that we walk
So easily caught

Why don't you fool me,
Feed me, say you need me
Without wicked games?
Come on and hold me,
Hug me, say you'll love me
And not my dirty brain.
