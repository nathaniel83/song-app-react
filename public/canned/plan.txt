In my prison cell I think these words 
I was careless 
I can see that now 
I must be silent 
Must contain my secret smile 
I want to tell you 
You my mirror 
You my iron bars 

When I made a shadow on my window shade 
They called the police and testified 
But they're like the people chained up in the cave 
In the allegory of the people in the cave by the Greek guy 

No one understands 
No one knows my plan 
Why the dancing, shouting 
Why the shrieks of pain 
The lovely music 
Why the smell of burning autumn leaves 

No one understands 
No one knows my plan 
Why the dancing, shouting 
Why the shrieks of pain 
The lovely music 
Why the smell of burning autumn leaves 

In my prison cell I bide my time 
Always thinking 
Always busy cooking up an angle 
Working on the tiny blueprint of the angle 
Sketching out the burning autumn leaves 

No one understands 
No one knows my plan 
I must be silent, must contain my secret smile 
I want to tell you 
You my mirror 
You my iron bars 

No one understands 
No one knows my plan
