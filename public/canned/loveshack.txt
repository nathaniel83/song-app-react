If you see a faded sign by the side of the road that says
Fifteen miles to the, Love Shack, Love Shack yeah
I'm headin' down the Atlanta highway
Lookin' for the love getaway
Headed for the love getaway, love getaway
I got me a car, it's as big as a whale
And we're headin' on down to the Love Shack
I got me a Chrysler, it seats about twenty
So hurry up and bring your jukebox money

The Love Shack is a little old place where
We can get together
Love Shack baby
A Love Shack baby
Love Shack, baby Love Shack
Love Shack, baby Love Shack
Love Shack, baby Love Shack
Love Shack, baby Love Shack

Sign says, woo, stay away fools
'Cause love rules at the Love Shack
Well it's set way back in the middle of a field
Just a funky old shack and I gotta get back
Glitter on the mattress
Glitter on the highway
Glitter on the front porch
Glitter on the hallway

The Love Shack is a little old place where
We can get together
Love Shack, baby
Love Shack, baby
Love Shack, that's where it's at
Love Shack, that's where it's at

Huggin' and a-kissin', dancin' and a-lovin'
Wearin' next to nothing 'cause it's hot as an oven
The whole shack shimmies
Yeah the whole shack shimmies
The whole shack shimmies when everybody's movin' around
And around and around and around
Everybody's movin', everybody's groovin' baby
Folks linin' up outside just to get down
Everybody's movin', everybody's groovin' baby
Funky little shack
Funky little shack

Hop in my Chrysler, it's as big as a whale
And it's about to set sail
I got me a car, it seats about twenty, so come on
And bring your jukebox money

The Love Shack is a little old place where
We can get together
Love Shack baby
A Love Shack baby
Love Shack, baby Love Shack
Love Shack, baby Love Shack
Love Shack, baby Love Shack (oh baby that's where it's at)
Love Shack, baby Love Shack (baby that's where it's at)

Bang bang bang on the door baby!
Knock a little louder baby!
Bang bang bang on the door baby!
I can't hear you
Bang bang bang on the door baby!
Knock a little louder sugar!
Bang bang bang on the door baby!
I can't hear you

Bang bang bang on the door baby, knock a little louder
Bang bang on the door baby, bang bang!
On the door baby, bang bang!
On the door, bang bang!
On the door baby, bang bang!

You're what?
Tin roof
rusted!

Love Shack, baby Love Shack!
Love Shack, baby Love Shack!
Love Shack, baby Love Shack!
Love Shack, baby Love Shack!
