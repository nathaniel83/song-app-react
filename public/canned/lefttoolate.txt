And the boys, boys with their toys, toys
Say goodbye, not for the last time
The boys, boys with their toys, toys
Say goodbye, you're walking the line

Buy a one way ticket far away from here
Don't think I'll let you, I'll never forget
Buy a one way ticket, get me out of here
I popped your bubble 'cause, baby, now I've

Left too late
All the things that I wanted to say
To you fade away
And you get what you give

But you're taking too much and I
I'm not asking for much
But enough has happened before
Wonder why at night when I lie awake, you're there on the floor

And the boys, boys with their toys, toys
Know the score, I'm not gonna wait for
The boys, boys with their toys, toys
Wanting more, they're losing the war

Buy a one way ticket far away from here
Don't think I'll let you, I'll never forget
Buy a one way ticket get me out of here
I popped your bubble 'cause baby, now I've

Left too late
All the things that I wanted
To say to you fade away
And you get what you give

But you're taking too much
And I, I'm not asking for much
But enough has happened before
Wonder why, at night when I lie awake you're there on the floor

My heart, I've left it open
Just one too many times
My heart can never be broken
You made a promise
That you'll always be mine

My heart, I've left it open
Just one too many times
My heart can never be broken
You made a promise
That you'll always be mine

Left too late
All the things that I wanted to say
To you fade away
And you get what you give

But you're taking too much
And I, I'm not asking for much
But enough has happened before
Wonder why, at night when I lie awake, you're there on the floor

Boys, boys with their toys, toys
Boys, boys with their toys, toys
Boys, boys with their toys, toys
