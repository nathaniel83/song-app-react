I pulled the trigger on our love
Keep messing me around
Got my finger on the gun
Bang bang I shot you down
I pulled the trigger on our love
Keep messing me around
Got my finger on the gun
Bang bang I shot you down
I pulled the trigger on our love
Keep messing me around
Got my finger on the gun
Bang bang I shot you down
I pulled the trigger on our love
Keep messing me around
Got my finger on the gun
Bang bang I shot you down
I pulled the trigger on our love
Keep messing me around
Got my finger on the gun
Bang bang I shot you down
I pulled the trigger on our love
Keep messing me around
Got my finger on the gun
Bang bang I shot you down

I think about it everyday
I shouldnt have hurt you that way
But its a little late to say
That I can erase your heartache

Thinking about it
Thinking about it

Oooooh baby
Thinking about it

Thinking about it
Oooooh baby
Thinking about it
Thinking about it
Thinking about it
Oooooh baby
Thinking about it
Thinking about it
